#5 This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A subarray can be empty, and in this case the sum is 0.

For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15 as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8 where the 8 is obtained from wrapping around.

Given [-4, 5, 1, 0], return 6 as we choose the numbers 5 and 1.

#4 This problem was asked by Google.

Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.

For example, given the following rectangles:
```
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
```
and
```
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height
}
```
return 6.

#3 This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them.

For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14.

#2 This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism:

- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Parametric polymorphism
- Subtype polymorphism

#1 This problem was asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

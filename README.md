#11 This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair of elements in the subset (i, j) satisfies either i % j = 0 or j % i = 0.

For example, given the set [3, 5, 10, 20, 21], you should return [5, 10, 20]. Given [1, 3, 6, 24], return [1, 3, 6, 24].

#10 This problem was asked by Apple.

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:
```
  5
 / \
2  -5
```
Return 2 as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of 2 + 5 - 5.

#9 This problem was asked by Facebook.

Suppose you are given two lists of n points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. Imagine a set of n line segments connecting each point pi to qi. Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

#8 This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference.

#7 This problem was asked by Affirm.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and fee = 2, you should return 9, since you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4 dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.

#6 This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as [0, 1] and [1, 2], but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals (7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8), return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

---

#5 This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A subarray can be empty, and in this case the sum is 0.

For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15 as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8 where the 8 is obtained from wrapping around.

Given [-4, 5, 1, 0], return 6 as we choose the numbers 5 and 1.

---

#4 This problem was asked by Google.

Given two rectangles on a 2D graph, return the area of their intersection. If the rectangles don't intersect, return 0.

For example, given the following rectangles:
```
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
```
and
```
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height
}
```
return 6.

#3 This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them.

For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14.

---

#2 This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism:

- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- Parametric polymorphism
- Subtype polymorphism

---

#1 This problem was asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
